# Reflection

## Implemented/ Changes made based on feedback:

- Interactive map
  - All countries are showing up on the map together with the mean life expectancy for selected years
- Scales of our graphs have been reduced
- Layout of the landing page has been improved

## Not yet implemented:

- Toggle collapse menu

## Known issues (intend to fix this in the later milestone):

- Layout looks different for different machines (Windows, Linux and MacOS)
- Improve layout to reduce scrolling of the dashboard


Our dashboard does well in enabling a user to perform multi-dimensional analysis to understand the factors affecting life expectancy. However, if we are given a new column in our dataset, our dashboard may need additional enhancement. We will make improvements based on TA feedbacks and solve previous known issues. After building the first dashboard with Python, our second dashboard building using R is much easier. We think using R to manage the R layout is much easier compared to Python, as the syntax for R is more friendly. However, it is harder to manage the size, title, and legend position using Plotly in R. We also received feedbacks regarding our plot axis label to be more informative, but, we will try to address the suggestion based on our time width. We will address Ta's feedback on priority.
