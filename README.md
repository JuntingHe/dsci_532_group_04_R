Life Expectancy Indicator
================

[Life Expectancy](https://life-expectancy-indicator.herokuapp.com/)

## App Description

The landing page of the dashboard should have three global filters at
the left, namely year, continent, and country. Users will be able to
select multiple continents and countries as desired. A world map is
presented at the top of the dashboard with a tooltip at each continent
to show life expectancy data related to the selected continent. Under
the world map section, there is a scatter-plot for each country with
life expectancy as a fixed y-axis and the users will be able to change
the dimension in the x-axis, color, and size. This is required to
perform multi-dimensional analysis to understand factors affecting life
expectancy. The top right corner of the dashboard landing page contains
two line graphs that display the average life expectancy trend over time
by continents and country status. The life expectancy trend graph at the
bottom right corner would allow users to compare the average life
expectancy of a specific country against its continent and the world.
