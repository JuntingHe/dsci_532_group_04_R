# Team Contract

We, Zhanyi Su, Joshua Lim, Junting He, and Debananda Sarkar, agree with the information documented in our team contract, and will try our best to uphold this charter. By pushing this document in our GitHub repository, we indicate our commitment to our team. All members of the group are to make equal efforts for the success of the group presentation. All group members are to fulfill the responsibilities of completing the assignment and making strong efforts for success related to group role expectations.

## Expectations

For the next several weeks, we will participate effectively in this group and strive to do the following:

- Come to lectures, labs and group meetings on time (If I miss a group meeting, I will inform the group members ahead of time).

- Come prepared to share with my group (If I am unable to prepare for the meeting or a portion of the project, I will make up additional work according to the group needs).

- Listen actively to what others have to contribute (If I appear to not listen, my group peers can ask me to focus and pay attention).

- Complete my portion of the project effectively (If I am unable to finish my part, I will notify my group members at least 12 hours before submission deadline).

- Be supportive of the efforts and initiatives of others (If I am too critical, my group peers can point this out and ask me to soften my approach).

- Be respectful at all times (If I demonstrate disrespectful behaviour, my group members have the right to ask me to stop).
